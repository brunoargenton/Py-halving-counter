This Python application provides a simple tool to calculate the estimated time until the next Bitcoin halving based on the current block height. 
It uses the historical pattern of Bitcoin halvings, which occur approximately every 210,000 blocks, to estimate the remaining blocks until the next halving and the time in hours until that event.
